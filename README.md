# UK-Traffic-Accident-Data-Analysis

**1. Background**

Traffic accidents are a significant concern, with nearly one-third proving to be fatal. Factors like weather conditions, road type, speed, light conditions, and road surface contribute to these accidents. In 2019, the UK Department for Transport reported 153,158 road accidents, resulting in 1,472 fatalities and 25,945 serious injuries. This underscores the need for effective measures to enhance road safety.

**2. Motivation**

The UK is a global leader in road safety, yet thousands of accidents occur annually, leading to severe injuries and fatalities. Issues like speeding, poor road conditions, and vulnerable road users (pedestrians and cyclists) are prevalent. Despite the availability of data, there are no centralized dashboards or tools to present this data clearly and effectively.

**3. Dataset Description and Challenges**

The dataset was sourced from the UK Department of Transport's official website, covering traffic accidents from 2019 to 2021. It includes information on accident severity, road type, weather conditions, and more. The dataset was challenging to compile due to limitations in downloading large volumes of data, necessitating a segmented approach by country and region.

**4. Visualization**

We used Tableau for data visualization, creating dashboards to represent the analysis visually. These dashboards include:

  - Accident trends over time
  - Severity and road type analysis
  - Peak hours for accidents
  - Demographic analysis of casualties
  - Impact of weather conditions
  - Speed limit impact on accidents
  - Junction type analysis
  - Day-of-week accident trends
